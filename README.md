## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (for form validation & interactions)

### What I learned

During this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- Form validation using JavaScript.

- Accessibility considerations, including ARIA attributes.

- Responsive design techniques using Flexbox and Grid.

- Handling form submission events and error handling.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Implement real-time form validation feedback.

- Explore form submission handling with a backend API.

- Improve accessibility using more advanced ARIA roles and attributes.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Form Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation) - Helped me understand client-side form validation.
- [CSS-Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
